# New Relic NestJs Integration Example

> **Warning**
> Please note that using a custom interceptor is unnecessary when instrumenting with the latest versions of the New Relic Node agent. In fact, using a custom interceptor may cause conflicts and lead to unexpected behavior (starting with [10.1.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes/node-agent-10-1-0/) released May 4th, 2023). Please see instead [this example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-node-examples/tree/main/nestjs) on how to enable New Relic instrumentation for Nest.js. That said, you can still use this repository to experiment with NestJs and the New Relic agent, and easily send data to the New Relic platform.

### App Architecture

![NestJs_NewRelic_architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6328360/112493022-b0b2d000-8d79-11eb-812f-9622b0917f8e.png)

The above diagram shows the (dockerized) architecture of the example app with the following components:
 * `nest network` - where all the microservices reside
 * `parent` container - the outer left
 * `child` container - in the middle
 * booth `parent` and `child` have New Relic NodeJs Agent installed (and required by each of the microservices)
 
 ### Hot to run
 
#### Prerequisites
* New Relic Account (sign up [here](https://newrelic.com/signup))
* New Relic License Key (find instructions [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/new-relic-license-key/))
* Docker` is installed on your machine.

#### Setup
Find two `newrelic.ts` config file in `/src` directory inside both `parent` and `child`

Change two config variables in each file

```
app_name: ['YOUR_APP_NAME'],
license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY'
```
to a desired `app_name` and paste your New Relic License Key acquired in previous steps to `license_key` variable.


#### Start
Run `docker-compose up` and wait for all images to install and start the app.

#### Use
The `parent` service has the following endpoints:
* GET `localhost:3000/`
  * just to confirm the app works
* POST `localhost:3000/cats/create`
  * to create a cat
  * with a json body payload containing 3 properties `name`, `age` & `breed`
    ```
    // for example 
    {
        "name": "Tom",
        "age": 3,
        "breed": "Persian"
    }
    ```
* GET `localhost:3000/cats/getAll`
  * to get all cats


Call any of these endpoints and you'll see a message (similar to the one below) in the console:

This particular example is a console log showing the flow of the GET `localhost:3000/cats/create` request. It's visible that `parent` calls `child` and gets a response back
intercepting `child`'s response carrying a `mongodb` record being created by `child`'s interaction with `mongodb` service.

#### New Relic Observability Platform

Once you make a few calls, go to you New Relic account where the app data is being send and navigate to `Explorer` and find the app (by the name you gave it to during the setup)
Go to `Distributed Tracing` and click on one of `Root Entry Spans`

You should be able to see `Distributed Tracing` spans captureg by New Relic Agents installed in both `parent` and `child`
